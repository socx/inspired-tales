## Mark 9 Story
A story actually inspired by Mark 9, where Jesus healed a manâ€™s son who was possessed by demons.  Many generations down the line in the 21 century a descendant of the child who was an accomplished, multi-award winning medical scientist, now retired, reflected on his own childhood and called to mind this story of how an ancestor came across Jesus and got delivered from the demon-possession. Although he had carried this story with him through life with skepticism he was about to have an encounter of his own.
