## I. The Prologue: The Nimrod Exorcism

It was a cool summer evening in Portage County, Ohio, the kind of evening where the air was thick with the smell of pines and wildflowers, and the sky took on a bluish hue as dusk settled over the horizon. Eight-year-old Benjamin Rabinowiscz was sitting cross-legged on the wooden floor of his great-aunt Esther’s living room. His face was rapt with attention, eyes wide as saucers, hanging on every word.

Esther was a small woman with a voice like honey, gentle and low, but with a resonance that carried. She was over seventy by then, her thin, silver hair swept back into a loose bun and her eyes bright with that spark of mischievous life that seemed to evade age itself. Benjamin spent his summers with her—days filled with wandering her wild, overgrown gardens and learning Yiddish words and stories that seemed to stretch back to the dawn of time.

But none of her stories were as intriguing as the one she called The Day of the Healer. It was the story she only told him once, when he was young enough to be fully enchanted and just old enough to understand the mystery.

“You see, Benjamin,” she said, sitting across from him and fixing him with her piercing, wise gaze, “as you know our family wasn’t always here in America. We were in Europe just a couple hundred years ago, but even long before that, our people wandered and fled from one land to another, back to a time before these lands even had names. When the Romans ruled the world and our people lived in the holy land one of our own, a boy named Nimrod, was very sick…”

Benjamin leaned closer. “What happened to him, Auntie?”

She took a slow breath, her voice dropping even lower. “The boy—your ancestor, Nimmy—had what they called a ‘troubled spirit.’ Back then, people believed that dark forces, unseen spirits, could take hold of a person, especially children. And that’s what they believed had happened to this boy. He would shake uncontrollably, fall as if he were pushed, and even lose his voice for days at a time. His parents, desperate and ashamed, sought help from the priests, the physicians, anyone who would listen. But nothing helped, nothing at all.”

Benjamin was enraptured. It was as if Aunt Esther was weaving magic right there in the room, painting a picture of a time he could only imagine.

“Then, one day,” she continued, her eyes narrowing as if seeing the scene in her mind, “the family heard of a strange, wandering rabbi not an official teacher like the priests. He was different, they said. He had followers and enemies alike, and they said he did things no one else could explain.”

“Was he real?” Benjamin whispered, his little fingers gripping the hem of his shorts.

“Oh, I strongly believe so,” Aunt Esther replied with a small smile. “People saw him, touched him, watched him heal those who were sick and cast out evil spirits that tormented people. It was said that he even brought a child back to life.”

She paused, letting the weight of her words settle. “Nimrod’s parents were desperate. The priests were turning them away, claiming they were cursed. So they went to find this wandering rabbi, hoping, praying that he would help. They found him on a dusty road, surrounded by people asking him for miracles, begging him for answers. And do you know what happened, Benjamin?”

Benjamin shook his head, eyes as wide as the full moon. “What happened?”

Aunt Esther leaned in close, her face inches from his, her voice barely more than a whisper, yet each word seemed to reverberate with an almost otherworldly intensity. “He saw Nimrod,” she began, her eyes wide and shining with the memory of the story, “and without a word, the rabbi’s gaze locked onto him. It wasn’t an ordinary look—it was like he was staring straight through the boy’s flesh, into the darkness hiding within. They say it was as though he could see the demon itself, writhing, clawing to stay hidden.”
Benjamin felt a shiver crawl down his spine. The room, warm moments ago, now felt cool, and the shadows in the corners seemed to stretch and shift.
“Nimrod’s father, Balaak—desperate, trembling—fell at the rabbi’s feet,” Esther continued, her voice dropping lower. “He begged, pleaded for help, his words tangled with sobs. ‘I believe,’ he cried, ‘but help my unbelief!’ The rabbi listened, but his focus never left the boy. Then, with a voice that cut through the chaos, he said, ‘Bring the child to me.’”
Benjamin swallowed hard, his heart thudding in his chest.
“The moment the boy was brought closer,” Esther’s voice quavered, “he collapsed to the ground, thrashing, his screams echoing with something inhuman, something that didn’t belong to this world. People watching said the air itself seemed to grow heavy, charged with a presence they couldn’t explain. The crowd recoiled, some turning away, unable to bear the sight. And yet, the rabbi stood firm, his hand raised—not in fear, but in authority.”
Her hands gripped Benjamin’s tightly, as if to anchor him in the moment. “They say the rabbi’s voice thundered—not loud, but commanding, like it came from the depths of the earth and the heights of heaven all at once. He didn’t shout or plead. He simply declared. ‘Come out of him and never enter him again.’”
Benjamin’s breath caught as Esther leaned even closer, her eyes glowing with the fervor of the tale. “And then it happened. The boy screamed one last time—a sound so terrible it chilled every soul who heard it. His body arched, twisting unnaturally, his hands clawing at the ground. And then… it stopped. Just like that.”
She sat back, her voice trembling but strong. “Nimrod lay still, limp, like a rag doll discarded by a cruel child. The crowd watched in stunned silence, waiting. Then, slowly, the boy opened his eyes. And they were clear, Benjamin. Clear as the sky after a storm. No more torment. No more darkness. He was free.”
The weight of her words hung in the air between them. Benjamin’s imagination raced with the images she had painted, his young mind grappling with the strange, terrifying beauty of it all. He shivered again, but this time it wasn’t just fear—it was awe.


For young Benjamin, the story became a strange kind of talisman. He carried it with him as he grew, remembering it on long nights under the stars and in quiet moments when he wondered if there might be forces beyond what he could see. But as he grew older, that memory dulled. He began to feel ashamed of the story, relegating it to the realm of family folklore, a story told to children to make the world seem a little more magical.

It wasn’t until he was twelve, sitting on the front porch with his grandfather on another summer evening, that the story resurfaced. His grandfather, a stern man who rarely spoke of the family’s Polish heritage, recounted a different version of the tale. In his telling, the wandering rabbi was not a revered healer but a simple wood worker whose “magic” was a matter of ancient superstition. “Back then,” his grandfather had said with a shake of his head, “people saw what they wanted to see. They were desperate, uneducated. But today, we know better.”

His grandfather’s explanation seemed more reasonable to young Benjamin’s increasingly scientific mind. Over the years, his view of the story shifted further into skepticism. To him, it was a relic of a more primitive time—a comforting myth for desperate people who lacked the tools of modern medicine and psychology.

Yet, even as Benjamin’s career in medicine grew and he became renowned for his groundbreaking research, the story lurked in the back of his mind. Sometimes, after long nights in the lab or at conferences where he brushed shoulders with the greatest minds of his time, he would think of that young boy, his ancestor, healed by a carpenter on a dusty road. And he would ask himself: could there be anything beyond the explanations he had devoted his life to?

Benjamin spent decades building a career around answers, facts, and data. He encountered many “miracle” claims and quickly dismantled them, proving time and time again that science held the real keys to healing. Yet as he entered retirement, the story of his ancestor would occasionally surface, a tiny, annoying grain of doubt in his otherwise rational world.

It was only when he received his own terminal diagnosis that the legend told to him by his aunt began to truly haunt him. The great scientist who had achieved so much, traveled the world, and lived a life of reason was left wondering whether the tale of his ancestor’s healing could hold any relevance for him. As his health deteriorated, he could almost hear Aunt Esther’s voice, reminding him of that day, that moment when his ancestor’s life had changed forever.

The questions he had buried were now resurfacing: Was Nimrod’s exorcism true? Who was this wandering rabbi? Could it be that he had truly seen beyond the veil of the natural world? And if so, was there something he had overlooked, something that no textbook or research paper could explain?

It was then, in the darkness of his illness, that Benjamin’s journey would take a turn he could never have predicted. The story of his ancestor had always been there, waiting for him, a doorway he had refused to enter. And now, he would walk through it—perhaps to find healing, or perhaps simply to find peace in the face of the unknown.


## II.  A Persecuted People

The story of Balaak, the father of the boy healed by the wandering rabbi, did not end with the miraculous exorcism. That singular event, seared into the fabric of their family history, marked the beginning of an extraordinary, tumultuous journey. Balaak’s life was irrevocably altered the moment he encountered the wandering rabbi, and it set in motion a chain of events that would shape his descendants for generations.

### The Call to Follow  

The morning after the exorcism, Balaak found himself drawn to the rabbi. While the crowds dispersed and life in the village began to settle, Balaak could not shake the feeling that his encounter with the rabbi had been more than a miracle—it had been an invitation. He sought him out in the shaded corner of a courtyard where he rested with a few of his closest followers. The rabbi’s presence, though unassuming, radiated a calm authority that both reassured and challenged Balaak.
As Balaak approached, the rabbi looked up as if expecting him. His eyes, the same ones that had pierced through the torment within Balaak’s son, now studied him with understanding and kindness.
“Master! I want to follow you,” Balaak said, his voice steady despite the swirl of emotions in his chest. “To serve you in whatever way I can.”
The rabbi regarded him for a moment before speaking, his voice gentle yet firm. “Balaak, the path I walk is not easy. Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. To follow me is to deny yourself, to take up your cross, and to lose your life for my sake and the gospel’s.”
Balaak hesitated but only for a moment. “I understand,” he said. “You gave my son back to me. You showed me a glimpse of a kingdom beyond this world. Whatever cross there is to bear, I will bear it. I owe you everything.”
The rabbi’s expression softened. “Do not follow me because you believe you owe me, Balaak. A debtor’s heart will falter under the weight of sacrifice. Follow me because you believe in the promise of the kingdom of heaven, where the first will be last, and the last will be first. Those who leave their homes, their families, and their livelihoods for my sake will receive a hundredfold in the age to come. But make no mistake, there is a cost in this life.”
“I believe I will be given what I need to bear whatever comes,” Balaak replied earnestly.
The rabbi smiled, a mixture of approval and caution. “Faith like yours is the foundation of the kingdom. But count the cost, Balaak. The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”

#### A Family’s Enthusiasm  

When Balaak returned home that evening, his face was alight with a newfound purpose. Miriam and their two sons, Nimrod and Ariel, listened as he recounted his conversation with the rabbi, who he now referred to as “Master”. His fervor was infectious, and for a time, the family shared in his excitement.
“This is a great honor,” Miriam said, her voice filled with pride. “To be called to follow such a man—one who speaks with wisdom and authority and who can perform miracles. Of course, you must go.”
Nimrod, still young and awestruck by his own miraculous healing, nodded enthusiastically. Ariel, the elder son, was more reserved but respectful.
“You have our blessing,” Miriam added, her hand resting on Balaak’s.
At first, life continued with only minor disruptions. Balaak traveled with the rabbi for short periods, returning home between journeys. He shared stories of the rabbi’s teachings and the miracles he had witnessed, and his parchments filled with his Master’s words became treasured objects in their home.
But as Yeshua’s ministry expanded, so did Balaak’s commitment. The journeys grew longer, the time between his returns more infrequent. Miriam found herself alone more often than not, managing the household and raising their sons without the support of her husband.

---

#### The Dialogue with Miriam  

One evening, shortly after Balaak’s return from an extended journey, Miriam prepared a modest meal. The boys had already gone to bed, and the house was quiet save for the crackle of the hearth. As they sat together, the weight of her thoughts pressed down on her.
“I missed you,” Miriam began, her voice calm but tinged with sadness.
“I missed you too,” Balaak replied, reaching for her hand.
She hesitated, then looked him in the eye. “I understand why you’re doing this. After what he did for Nimrod, how could you not? But sometimes, I wonder… Is this just your way of paying him back?”
Balaak looked taken aback. “Paying him back?”
“Yes,” she said gently but firmly. “Your faith is strong, Balaak, but it feels… transactional. He healed our son, so now you feel you owe him your life. Is that what this is?”
Balaak paused, gathering his thoughts. “At first, perhaps it was. How could I not feel indebted to the man who freed our son from that torment? But it has become so much more than that. The healing was only a glimpse of something far greater—salvation. Eternal life. Miriam, the Master is not just a healer or a teacher. He is the Messiah. To follow him is to walk the path to the kingdom of God.”
“And what of us?” she asked, her voice breaking slightly. “What of Nimrod and Ariel? What about your family? Do we not need you here, walking the path with us?”
Balaak reached for her hand again, his grip firm yet tender. “I know I’ve been away more than I should. And I know it’s been hard on you, harder than you let on. But Miriam, I believe this is my purpose—my assignment. The Master’s words, his deeds—they are not just for us, but for generations to come. Someone must preserve them, someone must ensure they are not forgotten. That someone, I believe, is me.”
Miriam searched his face, her own a mixture of frustration and admiration. “I see your conviction,” she said. “And I believe you believe this is right. But it’s not easy, Balaak. I feel like I’m carrying this burden alone.”
“You are not alone,” he said, his voice filled with emotion. “And I promise to do better, to be here when I can. But I need you to understand—this is bigger than us. It’s bigger than Nimrod and Ariel. It’s about something eternal.”
Miriam looked away, tears welling in her eyes. After a moment, she nodded. “I believe you,” she said softly. “I believe in the path you’ve chosen. And though it’s hard, I will walk it with you.”
They sat in silence for a while, the weight of their shared decision settling over them. Though conflicted, Miriam felt a deep sense of peace. She believed they were on the right path, even if it was fraught with challenges.

From that night forward, Miriam embraced Balaak’s calling with renewed determination. Though the toll on their family was undeniable, they faced it together, bound by their faith and the hope that their sacrifices would bear fruit for generations to come.

#### The Rabbi's Chronicler

The parchment in Balaak’s hands grew heavy as he scribbled furiously, trying to capture every word the Master had spoken earlier that day. His role as chronicler was a self-imposed duty, born out of his awe for the rabbi and a sense of urgency to preserve what he believed were the words and deeds of the Messiah. Yet, the more he wrote, the more questions he had. The Master’s teachings were profound, but they often left his followers—including Balaak—confused and even unsettled.

---

#### A Shocking Prediction
It was during one of their longer journeys that the Master made a statement so unexpected it sent shockwaves through the group.
“The Son of Man must suffer many things,” he said, his voice calm yet heavy. “He will be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He must be killed, and on the third day, rise again.”
The words hung in the air, a sharp contrast to the idyllic backdrop of rolling hills and grazing sheep. Balaak looked around and saw the same shock reflected on the faces of the others.
“How can this be?” one of the disciples finally asked, breaking the uneasy silence. “You are the Messiah. The scriptures say the Ha-Mashiach will restore the throne of David, not be killed!”
Others chimed in, their voices rising with frustration and disbelief. “What good is a dead Messiah?” another asked. “The Romans still occupy our land. The temple is under their shadow. How will you conquer our oppressors if you are no longer here?”
Balaak could feel his own confusion bubbling to the surface. He had heard the prophecies of the Messiah all his life—the deliverer, the restorer of Israel. This prediction didn’t seem to align with any of it.
One of the closest followers could no longer contain himself. He stepped forward, his face a mixture of concern and defiance. “Never, Lord!” he exclaimed. “This shall never happen to you!”
The Master’s response was swift and startling. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said, his voice firm. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”
The rebuke silenced everyone. Balaak’s pen moved almost automatically as he recorded the exchange, but his mind reeled. Was this truly the path of the Messiah?

---

#### The Debate Over the Kingdom
<code>In the days that followed, the group was abuzz with debate. Some were convinced that the Master’s prediction was metaphorical, a parable they had yet to understand. Others worried it was literal and began questioning whether he truly was the Ha-Mashiach.
“If he is the Messiah, he should lead us against the Romans,” one argued as they sat around a fire one evening.
“Exactly,” another agreed. “The prophets speak of a king who will reign on David’s throne. Where does death fit into that?”
Balaak listened quietly, jotting down their words while grappling with his own doubts.
“But what if his kingdom is not of this world?” another voice countered. “What if he speaks of a spiritual victory rather than a physical one?”
This suggestion was met with scoffs and shaking heads. “Israel needs liberation, not riddles,” someone muttered.
The tension among the followers reached a boiling point when some in the crowd attempted to crown the Master as king. They saw in him the potential to rally the masses and form a parallel government to oppose the Roman occupation.
But he refused. He slipped away quietly, retreating to a solitary place. His refusal left his followers bewildered.
“How can he restore the kingdom to Israel if he won’t even claim it?” Balaak wondered aloud that night, writing down the incident with trembling hands.</code>

---

#### The Strange Exorcists
<code>One evening, the Master’s followers approached him with a complaint.
“Rabbi,” one of them began, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we told him to stop because he is not one of us.”
The Master’s response was surprising. “Do not stop him,” he said. “For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me. Whoever is not against us is for us.”
Balaak found this incident fascinating. On his next visit home, he recounted it to Miriam and the boys.
“Imagine,” Miriam said, her eyes wide, “if we had known it was possible to simply invoke his name. Nimrod’s years of suffering could have been so much shorter!”
“Or perhaps it wasn’t just the name,” Balaak mused. “Perhaps it was the faith behind it. That’s what the Master always emphasizes—faith.”</code>

---

#### Fondness for Children

<code>One of Balaak’s favorite moments to record was the Master’s interactions with children. Unlike the cultural norm that dismissed children as insignificant, the Master welcomed them openly.
There was a day when mothers brought their children to the Master, hoping he would bless them. The disciples tried to send them away, but the Master intervened.
“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,” he said, “for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.”
Balaak had watched as the Master knelt to speak with the children, answering their questions with patience and delight. It was moments like these that reminded Balaak why he followed this man.</code>

---

#### The Mother’s Request

<code>Not all interactions were as heartwarming. There was a particular incident that caused a stir among the group. The mother of James and John, two of the Master’s closest disciples, approached him with a bold request.
“Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom,” she said.
The other disciples were outraged. “Who are they to ask for such a thing?” they grumbled among themselves.
The Master addressed the situation with his usual grace. “You don’t know what you are asking,” he said. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?”
James and John nodded eagerly, but the Master’s response was sobering. “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”</code>


#### Growing Tensions
As the Master’s following grew, so did the tension with the religious authorities. Balaak recorded rumors of secret meetings where the Pharisees and Sadducees plotted against the rabbi. They were incensed by his teachings, which often challenged their authority, and alarmed by his growing influence among the people.
“The council fears a revolution,” Balaak wrote after overhearing a heated discussion in the marketplace. “They say his words will lead to an uprising, and Rome will crush us all in response.”
The rumors weighed heavily on the group. Some began to worry for their own safety, while others were emboldened by the idea that the Master might indeed lead them to liberation.
For Balaak, it was a time of both faith and fear. He continued to record everything he witnessed, knowing that these accounts might one day serve as a testament to the man he believed was the Messiah.
But in the back of his mind, a question lingered—if the Master’s path truly led to death, what would become of them all?


---

#### The Cost of Faith  

The storm broke with devastating force when the rabbi was arrested. Balaak was in Jerusalem when it happened, watching helplessly as the rabbi was dragged before the Sanhedrin, condemned by the high priests, and handed over to the Romans. The trial was a mockery of justice, and Balaak’s heart broke as he witnessed the rabbi, bloodied and bruised, carrying his cross through the streets of the city.
The crucifixion was a turning point. For Balaak, it was not the end but the beginning of something greater—a fulfillment of the very prophecies he had recorded. Yet, for many of the rabbi’s followers, it was a moment of despair. The man they believed would restore Israel was gone, and with him, their dreams of deliverance.
In the weeks that followed, Balaak returned home, determined to continue the work the rabbi had entrusted to his followers. But the resurrection, though celebrated among the faithful, brought little comfort to those who bore the brunt of persecution. The Roman authorities, eager to quell any hint of rebellion, began a brutal crackdown on the rabbi’s followers.

---

#### The Arson and Betrayal  

The persecution reached Balaak’s village in the form of angry mobs and soldiers eager to root out what they saw as a dangerous cult. Balaak, Miriam, and their children lived under constant threat, their faith now a mark of danger rather than hope. Balaak’s parchments, carefully hidden in the walls of their home, became both a treasure and a liability.
One fateful night, their home was set ablaze. The fire was no accident; it was arson, carried out by zealots determined to stamp out the rabbi’s followers. Trapped inside, Balaak and Miriam did their best to protect their children, but the flames spread too quickly.
Nimrod, the boy who had once been healed by the rabbi, perished alongside his parents, his cries lost in the roar of the fire. Ariel, the elder son, managed to escape, though the ordeal left him scarred—physically and emotionally.
Ariel’s survival came at a cost. Bitter and disillusioned, he renounced the rabbi and the faith that had brought such destruction to his family. In the aftermath of the fire, he took the parchments Balaak had so painstakingly written and hid them away—not out of reverence, but because they were the only tangible link to his father.
“I will keep these,” Ariel said to himself, “not because I believe, but because they are all I have left.”

---

#### A People Scattered  

The fire that consumed Balaak’s family was part of a larger wave of violence that scattered the rabbi’s followers across the known world. For the Jewish people, persecution was nothing new. Their history was one of exile and suffering—enslaved in Egypt, exiled in Babylon, oppressed by Rome. Yet, this new movement brought a unique kind of suffering. To follow the rabbi was to be ostracized not only by the Romans but by one’s own people.
As the years passed, Ariel grew into a man hardened by loss. He made a life for himself far from the faith of his father, burying the parchments in a hidden corner of his home. He married, raised a family, and taught his children to be wary of anyone claiming divine authority. But the parchments remained, a silent witness to the faith he had abandoned.
The story of the rabbi, as written by Balaak, survived not because of belief, but because of the resilience of a persecuted people. As Ariel’s descendants faced their own trials—pogroms, exiles, and the Holocaust—the parchments were passed down, each generation preserving them as a relic of their family’s tumultuous history.

---

#### The Legacy of a Scribe  

For centuries, the parchments remained hidden, their contents largely forgotten. Yet, they bore witness to a profound truth: that even in the face of persecution and death, the story of the rabbi endured. Balaak’s faith, his devotion, and his writings became a thread running through his family’s history—a thread that would one day be rediscovered by Nimrod Rabinowiscz, a man who, like Ariel before him, wrestled with doubt and faith.
The parchments, fragile and worn with age, carried more than the story of a wandering rabbi. They carried the story of a family torn apart by faith, of a people persecuted for their beliefs, and of a legacy that refused to be extinguished. Through fire and exile, they endured, waiting for the day when they would once again speak of the man who changed the world.
