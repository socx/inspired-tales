# The Demoniac's Descendant

## Background 
Inspired by the story from Mark 9:14-29 and Matthew 7:14-21, where Jesus healed a man’s son who was possessed by demons. Many generations down the line in the 20th century a descendant of the one who was delivered who himself was an accomplished, multi-award winning medical scientist, but now retired, reflected on his life and called to mind a legend that has passed down through the ages in his family. It was one of how an ancestor came across Jesus and got delivered from the demon-possession. Although he had carried this story with him through life with skepticism he was about to have an encounter of his own.


## Plot 
Benjamin Rabinowiscz, a retired medical research expert[1] was reflecting on his life and heritage. He recalled a legend that had been passed down through the generations in his family.

It was one of his ancestors who had been a great man in the history of his people. This ancestor was thought to have lived around 6BC to 60AD. Although, as there were no official records, it is difficult to ascertain the actual time of his life. Aspects of his story and the circumstances around it dates it back to the Roman Empire in its prime. He was said to have had a diffcult childhood having suffered an unexplained condition, which caused him to convulse and suffer greatly[2]. The episodes were initially mild as well as few and far in between, but after a while became more regular.and aggravated. Though there were many ailments which were simply unexplainable at the time due to limited advancements in medicine. But even for those times this was particularly strange. It seemed like a severe case of epilepsy, but there was certainly more to it.

No physicians could help him no matter how much his parents tried. It had become a source of shame to the family and heartbreak to his parents. But one day a young Aramaic speaking religious teacher had allegedly claimed the condition was a result of some unseen spirit which torments people by possessing their bodies and then oppresses them at random times. This Rabbi had supposedly then performed an exorcism by simply asking the spirit to leave the child’s body.

Truth be told, each rendition of the story had a slightly varying version, exposing the inaccuracy of the legend and casting doubt on the veracity of the account. “How the frontiers of medical science have been advanced over the time, he thought to himself. “… and how we as the human race have moved on from the dark ages when we took advantage of ourselves by reason of ignorance, deceiving one another with baseless claims of mysticism and other unfounded explanations for simple easily diagnosable medical conditions”, he continued in his thoughts. This he did, shaking his head at such absurdity, completely mystified by how unsuspecting simple people of old fell to the schemes of charlatans who had enriched their pockets and gained much influence in their day at the expense of simple minds.

Professor Benjamin Rabinowiscz[3] who was a professor of diagnostic medicine[4] from the Johns Hopkins university even though he’s German had emigrated to the United States as a refugee when the Nazis came into power. His emigration as a child and the circumstances surrounding it play a central role in his skepticism about God and even his own family history. Born in Berlin to a Rabbi father and homemaker mother. He was the fifth of seven children of whom six were boys and two were girls. Early childhood was fairly decent. Dad, Levi was an avid writer who published a fortnightly periodical about opinions of scholars on the dynamics of daily life with respect to staying within the Torah and Talmud. Levi had raised his kids with the Jewish culture. He had thought them the value of hardwork and determining your own destiny by applying yourself. It had worked, Benjamin like his siblings was very successful. He had contributed immensely to the field of medical research and had many awards to show for it. He had advised governments and international health organisations.

In one of his periodicals, Levi had alluded to the idolatry of Chrisitanity in following Jesus, who had claimed to be the Messiah, but who had failed to match the descriptions of what the Messiah according to the prophets. However, in the same publication mentioned his link to Jesus through an ancestor who had a personal encounter with him. The story of this encounter had been a family legend pased down through generations. Benjamin himself had first heard this from great-aunt Talia on one of his summer holidays visitng with her in Portage County, Winscosin[5][6].

The story comes to a close with Benjamin actually developing a rare medical condition himself and through a seven year period and highs and lows of the treatments, supposed healings and relapsing of his own medical condition he meets a young lady, Raissa who reminded him of his start in medical research. Raissa, an Indian, born and raised in Africa had been making the news due to groundbreaking research she had done in the area of pancreatic cancer research[7]. The research had led to the procedure that could help with early detection of the cancer. And she was now working on a new research

Benjamin’s visit to Raissa had led to rounds of dialogues between them that started with his condition and the medical pathological basis of disease in general. Over time their conversations moved into their personal philosophies and what formed the core of it. Soon Raissa’s own background as an atheist who later became a follower of Jesus (the Yeshua in Benjamin’s ancestor’s story) after her own personal encounter on her first role as a medical researcher surfaces. Initially, met by skepticism and even slight ridicule from Benjamin. Later on he revealed the story of his ancestor’s supposed exorcism by this same Jesus). Raissa was blown away by what she considered such a rich heritage as she considered having an ancestor who actually met Jesus in person.

Benjamin never got healed of the disease, but he came out of retirement to work with Raissa and together they found a cure to the condition although not in time for Benjamin to benefit from it, but on his deathbed he became a follower of Jesus.


## Outline

#### The Prologue: The Ancestor’s Encounter

In first-person narration, Nimrod Rabinowiscz, a retired, world-renowned medical scientist, reflects on his life and heritage, beginning with the story of his ancestor. Nimrod recounts hearing the tale from his great-aunt during his childhood summers in Portage County, Winscosin, and later from his grandfather, who described the healer as a “carpenter rabbi” named Yeshua. They spoke of an ancient healing—an exorcism—that freed a child from a demon’s grip after a desperate family encounter with the man known as Jesus of Nazareth. 

While Nimrod loved these stories as a child, as he grew older and became a scientist, he viewed them with skepticism. His career introduced him to cases that seemed miraculous at first, but closer scrutiny revealed scientific explanations. The stories from his childhood were shelved away, filed under “myth and legend.” 

#### II. From Faith to Science: The Rise of Nimrod Rabinowiscz

Nimrod’s journey through his career as a medical researcher and scientist is marked by a dedication to truth and hard evidence. He reflects on the irony that the "ancient family miracle" played no role in shaping his life choices. Instead, his relentless curiosity and drive were fueled by a deep desire to understand the “why” and “how” of illness and healing.

In his early career, he encounters a faith healer charlatan who led a whole village to believe in a cure that wasn’t real, causing an outbreak of untreated infections and deaths. This experience fuels his disdain for anything resembling "miraculous" claims, deepening his skepticism about the story of his ancestor’s healing.

#### III. A Diagnosis Unwelcome

Nimrod's life is abruptly changed when he’s diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of pancreatic disease that he initially downplays, certain that modern medicine will have a solution. His faith in science falters as he goes through years of treatments, periods of remission, and painful relapses. The disease becomes his silent companion, wearing down his body and mind, pushing him to explore the alternative paths he had long disdained.

#### IV. Meeting Raissa: A Shared Path

Nimrod hears of Raissa Adeyemi, an African-born Indian medical researcher making groundbreaking advancements in pancreatic cancer research. Driven by a glimmer of hope, he seeks her out, hoping that her new detection technique might hold the key to his own survival. Their initial meetings are scientific and formal, but he’s struck by her passion and dedication, seeing a version of his younger self in her.

As Nimrod and Raissa spend more time together, their conversations shift from science to philosophy and belief. Raissa, a former atheist turned devout follower of Jesus, shares her own journey. She speaks of her encounter with faith not as something mystical, but as the very thing that grounds her in the challenges of research and life. 

#### V. The Dialogues: Faith Meets Science

Nimrod is initially dismissive of Raissa’s faith. But she listens to him without judgment, respecting his journey and his questions. Gradually, he shares the story of his ancestor and the strange exorcism story that had always lingered at the edge of his memory. Raissa, rather than being skeptical, is fascinated. She sees this as a powerful connection and expresses awe at the idea of having such a heritage.

Their dialogues move deeper, exploring the intersection of science and faith, the limitations of both, and what it means to seek answers beyond what the eyes can see. Nimrod finds himself questioning his long-held certainties, feeling a pull toward something he doesn’t yet understand but feels compelled to explore.

#### VI. The Legacy of Yeshua

Nimrod, weakened by his illness but driven by the unfinished work he and Raissa started, returns to research. Together, they push the boundaries of their studies, uncovering insights that lead to a breakthrough in treatment. As they get closer to a cure, Nimrod begins to accept that it may not come in time for him. 

In his final days, Nimrod comes to terms with his life, understanding that his journey was part of a larger legacy—a lineage not only of science but of faith. He recognizes that the power of Yeshua was not simply about healing but about transforming lives and transcending time.

#### VII. The Deathbed Confession

In his last moments, Nimrod opens his heart to the faith he’d held at arm’s length his whole life. Surrounded by Raissa and his family, he chooses to believe, honoring the memory of his ancestor and the carpenter who’d changed his family’s destiny. His last act is not only one of belief but of gratitude for the life he’s led and the lives his work will continue to touch.

#### VIII. Epilogue: The Cure Lives On

After Nimrod’s passing, Raissa completes the research they started, finalizing a treatment that will go on to save thousands of lives. She speaks of Nimrod often, sharing the story of his ancestor and the legacy of Yeshua that traveled through the centuries. Nimrod’s journey becomes a testament to the power of belief, the legacy of healing, and the interconnectedness of science and faith.
